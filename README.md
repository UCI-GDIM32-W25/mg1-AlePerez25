Many of the annotations we made as a team were not very accurate, but there were a few things I did implement, such as the “speed” variable in my current code. I used it to make the rabbit move by multiplying it by Time.deltaTime and the movement vector. The importance of UI was also mentioned, which I implemented in my code. I even created a GameObject to attach the UI script and ensure the seed count was correct. We discussed using the keyboard to move the rabbit, which was also a very extensive part of my code, structured using GetKey, the x and y axis coordinates, and if statements.

There were not many direct coincidences, but after reading the pre-review, the teacher’s example, and reviewing the resources section, I realized the plan was different, and it helped me a lot to complete the code. It took me some time because I had to recall everything from the previous quarter and look for examples in past assignments, but I was able to complete it. This time, the easiest part was setting up the inspector and the hierarchy.
